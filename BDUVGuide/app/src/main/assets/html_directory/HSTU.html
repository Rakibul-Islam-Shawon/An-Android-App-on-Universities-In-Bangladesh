            HSTU is relatively new as a university having been established in 1999. However, as an academic institution its history dates back to
            1979 when it started its journey as an Agricultural Extension Training Institute (AETI) created to offer three year diploma course in
            Agriculture. In a matter of a decade it was elevated to degree-giving institution in 1988 and named as Hajee Mohammad Danesh Agricultural
            College. Ultimately based on the performance of Agricultural College but more importantly to cater to the crying need for highly skilled
            manpower in Science and Technology and for promotion of research in these vital areas Prime Minister of that time Sheikh Hasina declared
            to upgrade Hajee Mohammad Danesh Agriculture College to Science and Technology University on February 1999 in a public meeting held at
            Gor-E-Shahid Maidan of Dinajpur. </br></br>On 6th September the property liabilities was handed over of former Agriculture College from Ministry
            of Agriculture to Ministry of Education. On the history of establishment of this University the 11th September is a glorious day. On
            this day of 1999 the Prime Minister of Peoples Republic Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina inaugurate the activities of this University by setting
            the foundation stone. After setting up the foundation stone, Prof.</br></br> Asnisur Rahman was appointed as Project Director to establish the
            university. First batch of the students were admitted at that time (1999-2000 session). The Act of the University was passed on 8 July
            2001 in the Jatio Shongsad (National Assembly) was followed by a gazette notification on 8 April 2002. At its inception it had inherited
            only the faculty of Agriculture but soon nine faculties were added to it. At present the faculties are: </br></br>
            (1) Agriculture </br></br>
            (2) Computer Science & Engineering</br></br>
            (3) Business Studies </br></br>
            (4) Engineering </br></br>
            (5) Fisheries </br></br>
            (6) Veterinary & Animal Science </br></br>
            (7) Science </br></br>
            (8) Social Science & Humanities and </br></br>
            (9) Post Graduate Studies. </br></br>
            There are total of 43 departments under these faculties. In addition to these Bachelor of Science offering faculties there is the Faculty
            of Postgraduate Studies offering MS and PhD degrees. Besides, there is also an Institute of Research and Training that conducts and
            coordinates research programmes and offers training to graduates and farmers. Thankfully, unlike most public universities of Bangladesh,
            HSTU does not suffer from session jam and is running smoothly.</br></br>




            About Hajee Mohammad Danesh</br></br>

            Hajee Mohammad Danesh (1900–1986) was a peasant leader and politician.He was born in Sultanpur village in Dinajpur District.
            He obtained his M.A. in History from Aligarh Muslim University in 1931 and B.L. degree in 1932. In the 1930s, Danesh became
            active in the communist organisations of Bengal, especially the Bengal provincial organisation of the Communist Party of India.
            He was arrested twice in 1938 by the government of Bengal for his participation in the Tebhaga movement, an agitation in northern
            Bengal against zamindars landlords for landless peasants and sharecroppers who sought a greater share of the yield, most of which
            was surrendered to the zamindars.</br></br> Danesh was one of the few Muslim communist leaders of the struggle, and worked to mobilise the
            Muslim peasantry in favour of the movement. In 1945, he joined the All India Muslim League, but was later expelled for his participation
            in the continuing Tebagha movement, and re-arrested by the Bengal government in 1946. After the partition of India and Bengal in 1947,
            Danesh remained in his home district of Dinajpur, which fell in Muslim-majority East Bengal, which became part of the newly created
            Muslim state of Pakistan. He died in Dhaka on 28 June 1986.</br></br>
