            Islamic University is ranked as one of the top public universities in Bangladesh as well as the largest seat of higher education in the south-western part of the country. Situated 24 kilometers south of Kushtia and 22 kilometers north of Jhenidah district-town, the university is by-passed by Khulna-Kushtia National Highway which provides its lifeline of connectivity with the rest of the country. The passing of the Islamic University Act in 1980 conferred this institution the permanent prestige of being the first university established after the independence of Bangladesh, reflecting the hope and aspiration of the new nation striving to be on par with other international players through the promotion of science, business, humanities, and interfaith dialogue.</br></br>

            By now, Islamic university has been exceptionally renowned as the major international center for theological, general, applied science and engineering studies. The university addresses the needs of both the local and foreign students, facilitating them with a broad spectrum of undergraduate studies and postgraduate research and teaching. In this way, the university seeks to promote understanding of the rich cultural diversity of humankind in order to prepare students to go forth with wisdom, skills, and knowledge to serve and advance the communities in which they live and work.</br></br>

            The main objective for establishing Islamic University is "to provide for instruction in theology and other fields of Islamic Studies and comparative jurisprudence and such other branches of learning at Graduate and Postgraduate level as the University may think fit and make provision for research including Post-Doctorate research and training for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge" [Clause 5(a), The Islamic University Act 1980(37)]</br></br>

            Faculties and Departments</br></br>
            At present the university offers a wide range of academic programs through its 33 full-fledged departments under five faculties and one self-contained Institute of Islamic Education and Research (IIER). The government-approved recent organogram of the university sets out to operate 59 departments under 8 faculties and 3 self-contained Institutes. </br></br>

            Mission</br></br>
            To provide for instructions in theology and other fields of Islamic studies and comparative jurisprudence and such other branches of learning at graduate and post-graduate levels and make provisions for research including post-doctoral research and training for advancement and dissemination of knowledge.</br></br>



            Objectives</br></br>
            To create a new generation of people who will be equipped with academic excellence, professional expertise and encored with moral height.</br></br>
            To extend the scope and increase opportunities for higher education and research in every branch of human knowledge and ensure the quality all along.</br></br>
