            Background</br></br>
            Since the 1990â€™s, size and nature of animal industry has been changing rapidly. Commercial dairy and poultry farming started recognizing as one
            of the most potential sectors for local and foreign investment. Livestock and poultry as a contributor to food security and nutrition has become
            one of the most important agenda for the policy makers and development partners. Rapid urbanization and changes of food habit among the city
            dwellers has been accelerated bringing about the changes in food industry with a gradual demand in academic reforms and expansion in need for
            developing technology and more skilled manpower in animal health, food processing and marketing.</br></br>

            The need of Bangladesh in the past and at present has been to increase the productivity of farm animal and the purpose of having veterinary
            graduates is still largely determined by the need of the small holding livestock farmers.  However, this reality was apparently ignored during
            the second change in veterinary education in Bangladesh. One of the causes of this narrow-based curricula approach for a professional education
            like veterinary medicine may be that the drive and energy for this change came primarily from the internal agendas of the academic community
            rather than from the external agendas of the wider society or the world of work. As a result, a strong debate was generated among professional
            bodies, government agencies and farmers community to bring new changes in veterinary education. While these debate countries, little or no
            change occurred in the higher education in veterinary medicine until the beginning of 1990s.</br></br>

            The inception of Chittagong Government Veterinary college in 1995 which  later transformed into Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences
            University was associated with the aforementioned social and economic changes and demands to overcome past weaknesses of the Veterinary education.</br></br>

            Journey towards CGVC to CVASU</br></br>
            To produce skilled and competent veterinarians of international standard through offering the combined courses (Veterinary and Animal Sciences)
            including internship, the government initially established two veterinary colleges in Sylhet and Chittagong respectively in the year 1995-96 and
            later added two more veterinary colleges in Dinajpur and Barishal. Chittagong Government Veterinary College (CGVC) started its journey on January,
            1996 admitting 50 students in its first academic session under the faculty of Science, University of Chittagong.</br></br>

            Subsequently, being satisfied with the academic activities, congenial environment and quality educational system, the University of Chittagong
            upgraded this affiliated college into separate Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with the approval of the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh (UGC).
            As a dense livestock industry based emerging zone, wide range and volume of quality livestock professionals, industry need specific research,
            development and service institutionalization in the entire Chittagong Division has long been sought. Realizing this potential of CGVC to enable
            to cater local demand, the elite society, educationists, politicians of different party, journalists, professionals and people from all walk of
            life of greater Chittagong brought them together to a common consensus and platform to raise a big demand and initiated a movement for the
            establishment of a Veterinary University in Chittagong.</br></br>

            As a result, The Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU) was established by the Act of the Government of the People's
            Republic of Bangladesh on 07 August, 2006 in order to confer 5 (five) years' Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree and Higher degrees on
            various other subjects/courses/fields and to enhance research and development in the field of Veterinary and Animal Sciences.  In its initial
            phase of development two new faculties namely, Faculty of Food Science and Technology and Faculty of Fisheries were planned to open within 5
            years of university inception.</br></br>

            The undergraduate study programme, with a compulsory one-year internship in different placements which was inaugurated by this university,
            is a major breakthrough in the veterinary education policy in Bangladesh. Since its establishment students are regularly doing their internship
            at all Government research center and hospital as well as Madras veterinary college under TANUVAS, India which was first aboard-undergraduate
            internship program of public universities in Bangladesh, recently the university has started to send their student for doing internship at Tufts
            University, USA and several universities of Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, Japan, India.</br></br> The university is thought to be one of the fastest growing
            universities in the country particularly for its scientific research efforts. University authorities have always focused on research, which in turn
            organizes International Internships seminar, International Scientific Conference every year where reputed scientists from several countries come
            and share their knowledge with the students. It is only public university of Bangladesh which has three research institutes in three separate zones.
            Significant number of its alumni are studying in abroad and published research findings in different prestigious journals and achieved International
            Award. They are going to lead a better position in every government and private sector of Veterinary, Fisheries and Food industry in Bangladesh.</br></br>

            Research, Training and Extension (R&D)</br></br>
            As part of its aim to build it as a centre of excellence in teaching and research, CVASU has been working and looking forward to develop and focusing
            research activities and resources to support and keeping its faculty members at the forefront of new technologies and development in the field of
            Veterinary and fisheries education quality enhancement, Livestock and Fisheries development and applied policy support, feed and feed technological
            innovation, application of advanced molecular techniques in disease diagnosis, Industry-Institute partnership and multidisciplinary research.</br></br>

            Primarily CVASU aims to project their research activities upon the multidisciplinary areas of Animal health, Production and Veterinary extension
            services. The faculty members are therefore, grouped into 3 basic research group including Small Animal and poultry health and production, Large
            Animal health and production and a Socio- economic group to assist the other two groups in executing, analysing and extension of their research
            findings.</br></br> However, at this stage of development a number of national and international funded research project have completed funded by Higher
            Education Link (DFID), UK, British Council, PLDP, BARC, and various research projects are ongoing funded by Higher Education Quality Enhancement
            Project (HEQEP) by UGC, BARC, RFLDC through DANIDA, BAS-USDA, FAO.</br></br>

            Poultry Research and Training Centre (PRTC)</br></br>
            The Poultry Research and Training Centre (PRTC) has been established on 11 March 2008 with the financial support from Agricultural Sector Programme
            Support (ASPS) II of Danida at the Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU) campus, within the legal framework of the university
            Act 2006 (Act 30 of 2006).</br></br> PRTC is an autonomous institution, in accordance with the provision of the university Act 16 July 2006. In recent years,
            Dr. Muhammad Kabirul Islam Khan, from Department of Genetics and Animal Breeding, was invented a new breed crossed between Faomi and indigenous
            chicken which will grow rapidly as Faomi but the taste of the meat will as the indigenous chicken.</br></br>
