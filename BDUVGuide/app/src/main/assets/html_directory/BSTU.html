       Bangabandu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University (BSMRSTU)) is a public university located in Gobra, Gopalganj, Bangladesh. It was established in 2001 and named after Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Academic activities of the university starts from 2011. Its mission is "To establish a digital university in Bangladesh that produces high quality graduates to propel bangladesh towards a digitally enriched nation in the world". This university is determined to bring the dream of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman into reality.</br></br>

History</br></br>
The birth process of the university began in 1999. Awami League government took the plan to set up 12 science and technology universities in 12 large districts where there are no universities in Bangladesh. In the first phase, six development project proposals were prepared for implementation. Among the six, the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University project was one of the top. On 15 November 1999, M. Khairul Alam Khan, Professor of Department of Applied Physics and Electronics Engineering of Rajshahi University was appointed Project Director and sent to Gopalganj.</br></br>

The Project Director, in his consolidation efforts, completed the work of university selection, land acquisition (about 55 acres) and land-building work. Already, on 8 July 2001, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University Act was enacted in the great parliament. On 13 July 2001, Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina formally laid the foundation for this university. On 14 July, the Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recommended M. Khairul Alam Khan as the Vice-Chancellor of the University. The recommendation was approved by Honorable President on 19 July 2001.</br></br>

In the election of 2001, the four-party alliance government of Jamaat-BNP came out in power and closed the university's project completely on April 15, 2002. Vice-Chancellor M. Khairul Alam Khan was sent to his previous institution, Rajshahi University. Moreover, 7 employees of the university were discharged from the service, so officials and employees were forced to live their lives completely without any work.</br></br>

Awami League started the government winning the 9th parliamentary elections held on December 29, 2008. In November 2009, the postponed project was revived and On 5 January 2010, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appointed M. Khairul Alam Khan again as Project Director. On 14 December 2010, he was appointed the Vice-Chancellor for four years and expired on December 13, 2014. On February 2, 2015. Khondakar Md Nasiruddin, Professor of Biotechnology Department of Bangladesh Agricultural University has been appointed as the Vice-Chancellor for 4 years by President, Dr. Abdul Hamid.</br></br>
