        <div class="infoclass">





Since the Library started work in the permanent campus, it has got a new dimension to serve the readers. Readers are getting a huge and wide space for study. Library has provided sufficient carrels for individual study and it can now accommodate about 200 readers  in the reading room at a time . Library has also turned to Open Shelve System (OSS) that means readers now can browse books and journals directly from the shelves, can see other relevant materials at a time. Library workers are also there to help the readers. </br></br>

Library has now got the facilities for the Faculties and Researchers to study in a separate corner. Library is going to establish an Internet browsing corner for research purposes. </br></br>

It is a matter of great pleasure to announce that AUST is now linked with Bangladesh-INASP/PERI Consortia (BIPC) under the auspices of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences (BAS) to have access to thousands of internationally reputed online journals  and books with downloading facilities of full text articles. Library is the focal point of this service. </br></br>

There was a long time demand of Automated Library Systems and to fulfill the demand a project for making software for this purpose has been undertaken in the mean time. After the completion of the work automated book search from the machine readable catalogue and mechanized book issue system will be available. </br></br>
